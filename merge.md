## What is a merge in Github?

Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. Note that all of the commands presented below merge into the current branch.

## How to merge branches?
```$ git merge```

To merge commits into the master branch, let's now switch over to the master branch.

```$ git checkout master```

## Note
Git will not allow you to merge until all changes in your current branch have been committed.

To resolve the issue:

```git checkout -b new-branch-name```

```git add . ```

```git commit -m "<your commit message>"```
