#What is a Repository?

A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

#How to use Repositories?
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.
